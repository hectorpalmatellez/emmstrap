#[Emmstrap](http://emmstrap.net)

The main objective of this project is to speed up the bootstrapping process using [Twitter Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap). Since we're civilized enough to use [Emmet](http://emmet.io/), we can do better.

###Included formulæ

  * Modal + button for it.
  * Tooltips - with its 4 forms.
  * Carousel - with 2 slides.
  * Collapse example.
  * Dropdown example.
  * Tabs - with content.

###Formulæ that should be included (possibly they'll be added soon)

  * (Waiting for ideas or suggestions)

####Credits
Obviously, [Twitter Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) and [Emmet](http://emmet.io/). Also thanks to [zClip](https://github.com/patricklodder/jquery-zclip) for the _copy to clipboard_ function.

####Resources
For the development of this project has been used:

  * [Emmet's cheatsheet](http://docs.emmet.io/cheat-sheet/).
  * [Bootstrap's Javascript page](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/).
  * [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/), with its `webapp` generator.


###FAQ
1. How do I use these formulas?
    
   * You need to have [Emmet](http://emmet.io) installed in your loved code editor. Then copy the formula you want and paste it in a document `.html` (or one that behaves like it), use the command to expand the formula (usually just `tab`) and there you go!
   
2. Why would I need these _formulæ_?
   * In case you're in a hurry and you'd like a cleaner version you can get from the Bootstrap examples. As a plus, they look smarter, according to [my dog](http://instagram.com/p/edH7zGMUXx/).
